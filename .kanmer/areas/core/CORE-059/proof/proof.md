# Verification proof — CORE-059

Remediated custom board-branch rename handoff by retaining the old remote ref until the operator retargets `KANMER_BOARD_BRANCH`. PR #182 merged at `94f7094b0b103aecec452f0e58ebaf0ad370f8ff`; recorded implementations `835f9f51` and `94f7094b` are reachable from `origin/main`.

## Merged-main target

The recorded implementation and merge commits for this ticket are ancestors of `origin/main` at verification head `a8cc6b01ca95340f1186bccc9770238036d080d8` (each `git merge-base --is-ancestor <recorded SHA> origin/main` exited 0). The PRs are MERGED; no feature-branch-only evidence is being used.

## Boundaries

Live Windows handle contention, packaged-host behavior, hosted branch/protection state, and external DNS/network behavior are INCONCLUSIVE unless explicitly proved by the above deterministic rails. No assertion was weakened and no external proof is fabricated.

The merged GUI Git suite passed 48/48, including retained-ref and warning behavior. Hosted repository-variable/protection mutation and external administrator handoff remain INCONCLUSIVE by design; the safe retained-ref warning path is deterministic.
